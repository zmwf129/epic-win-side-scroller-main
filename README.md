Theme: We are an exterminator in the sewers tasked with neutralizing an out-of-control rat infestation in the city sewers. Something is wrong with these rats...the deeper you go, the weirder they get. Fight through the rabid vermin and discover the source of their power.

3 LEVELS

- You cannot progress to the next level until all rats on current level have been exterminated
- Enemies donâ€™t follow the player, but move back and forth within a small boundary (up and down or side to side)
- Enemies get stronger and fewer as you progress through the levels (getting closer to the source of nuclear waste)

LEVEL 1:

- Normal rats (not evolved), numerous but weak enemies
- Sewers appear normal - brown/black water, rubbish

LEVEL 2:

- Beefy, bloody rats, fewer in number but stronger
- Sewers show signs of nuclear waste - neon green seeping into water, biohazard signs, corroded pipes

LEVEL 3:

- Final level is a room at the end of a tunnel
- Rat king, aka final boss, lives there protecting the pile of nuclear waste - the source of their power!!!
